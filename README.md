# init-esphome-installer
## Repository for the init-esphome command and install-init-esphome.sh command installer.

The `init-esphome` script creates project folders, ready set-up to perform professional IOT node development, using the ESPHome component software framework, inside a tailored Visual Studio Code environment, on Debian-style Linux systems. The `install-init-esphome.sh` script downloads and installs the `init-esphome` command.

### Prerequisites

Check that your Linux distribution has Python3 version 3.11 or later.
```
python --version
  Python 3.10.12  âœ— âœ“
```

Update python as necessary.

Add the software-properties-common package for the add-apt-repository command,
whether or not already installed.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```
Add the deadsnakes PPA (Personal Package Archive).
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
```
Add Python 3.12 as an alternative version of python3.
```
sudo apt install python3.12
```
Make it selectable via the update-alternatives system.
```
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.12 1
```
This configures which Python version runs when you type python3.


If you don't already have Microsoft Visual Studio Code installed, then add the repository and install it.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget gpg -y
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] \
https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

### Installation


To install the `init-esphome` command script in your ~/.local/bin folder, creating the directory and adding it to your path if it does not already exist, just run the following shell command.
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-Bug-Eyed-Monster/init-esphome-installer/refs/heads/main/install-init-esphome.sh | bash
```
> [!NOTE]
> This is an open-source resource, fully available for inspection.
> If you have security concerns, please review both the [`install-init-esphome.sh`](./install-init-esphome.sh) installer and the [`init-esphome`](./init-esphome) environment setup script before running the installer.

### Use
After installation, you may run the `init-esphome` script from any location, to download and set up an ESPHome development environment, in any chosen target folder. It will create the target folder if it does not already exist, then populate it with all the files required to perform professional IOT node development, including the ESPHome component software framework, and a tailored Visual Studio Code environment. Any downloaded Visual Studio Code extension recommendation has lasting, global effect. Conversely, all VS Code customisation is scoped to the working folder. i.e. When the working folder is erased, all customisation is lost.

**Usage:** `init-esphome <target-folder>`
